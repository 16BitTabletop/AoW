The yawning entrance to the Whispering Cairn lies about 10 minutes east of the abandoned mine office, a wide monolith-lined portal partially obscured by underbrush and boulders. Assuming the PCs have a general idea of where to look, discovering the entrance requires a DC 13 Search check. Unless the PCs spend 10 minutes working to clear the brush and assorted debris from around the entrance, treat the squares leading from the hillside to Area 1 as difficult terrain.

Unless otherwise noted, interior passages are 20' wide and 20' tall with ceilings of smooth stone.
