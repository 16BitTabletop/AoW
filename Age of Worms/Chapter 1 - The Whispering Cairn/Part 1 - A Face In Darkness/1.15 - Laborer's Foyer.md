### Lair of the Laborers
 Nadroc's creation of the Whispering Cairn required the assistance of 8 skilled Wind Duke laborers who dwelt in this sub-level. They were several layers below Nadroc in the complex social strata of the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, so the stonework and amenities of this level are markedly inferior to similar accoutrements in the Lair of the Architect. The ceilings on this level uniformly reach a height of 20 ft. Walls are worked stone.

### Laborer's Foyer
```
Dozens of bas-relief figures similar to the one on the sarcophagus lid in the room above stare disapprovingly from the walls here. Many sport crossed arms and stern expressions. A few of the statues' heads are missing, and some have huge chunks torn out of them. Others have a weird melted appearance, as if they'd been sprayed by something terrible. A large glyph that looks like a stylized arrow points down a short corridor to the north that leads to a 4-way intersection.

The damage to this room comes from the acid beetles inhabiting Area 16. The alcove in the south wall conforms to the shaft leading to Area 7 above. The shaft starts 20 feet above the floor of Area 15 and is pitted with acid-burned handholds (**DC 13 Athletics**). The glyph - Nadroc's personal sign - is identical to the one found on the amulet in Area 12.
