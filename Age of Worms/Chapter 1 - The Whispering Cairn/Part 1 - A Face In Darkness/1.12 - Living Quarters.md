This wide chamber must once have been the living quarters of an important figure. A large stone slab that suggests the shape of a bed rests against the east wall, under a huge bas-relief of a robust, long-nosed, bald humanoid figure with outstretched hands. The figure wears a lovingly sculpted wind-tossed robe that give him the appearance of a triumphant god. A glyph that looks like a stylized arrow marks an amulet worn around the figures neck. Wardrobes and dressers seemingly carved from the stone walls look to have been ransacked a long time ago.

This room was emptied of valuables centuries ago. A thin bed of whirling air rests atop the stone slab against the east wall. The wind is strong enough to suspend a Medium character above the stone comfortably, making it an excellent bed. Anyone sharing a space with the bed must make a **DC 20 Wisdom** save to avoid becoming fatigued. This effect ends when the PC is no longer in the bed's space. The glyph on the amulet is Nadroc's personal symbol, and is reproduced as the compas rose of the map of this dungeon level. See [[0.1 Wind Duke Glyphs]] for more information regarding this symbol.
