Fifteen feet down the east passage, a hughe pile of collapsed rubble blocks the alcove from top to bottom. It looks like it would take weeks to tunnel through the densly packed debris.

There's a functioning portal beyond this collapsed passage, but there is no way for the PCs to reach it now. This portal comes into play in a later chapter.

**Development**: If the PCs make too much noise in this area, they may be detected by the wolves in Area 4. Each of the three wolves has a -2 modifier on its Perception check due to distance. The DC for this check varies depending upon the PCs volume, ranging from 7 to 13.

Every 3 rounds, allow the PCs a **DC 16 Perception** check to notice a faint flickering green light coming from the north (Area 7G).
