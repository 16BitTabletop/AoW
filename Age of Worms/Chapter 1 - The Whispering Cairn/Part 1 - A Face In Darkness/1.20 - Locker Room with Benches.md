**Treasure**: A dead human body here bears the red lantern from Area 7. It wears red masterwork leather armor with the Seeker insignia over the left breast and a +1 short sword hangs in a molding scabbard on its belt. The corpses bones are very badly gnawed, and its armor has been torn apart and ruined as if by sharp claws. A **DC 12 Medicine** check reveals that the bones have been cracked open as if something was trying to get at the marrow within. The body has been dead for 50 years or more.
