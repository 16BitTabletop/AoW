8 man-sized stone slabs, about 4 feet off the ground, are arranged in 2 rows in this large room. A long-dead corpse, possibly a human, lays sprawled out upon one of these slabs, his red leather armor the only hint of color in the otherwise drab room. The north and south walls taper in somewhat, and the short west wall abuts a small stone stage. The red clay statue of a powerfully built warrior wielding a cylinder-headed greatclub stands tall upon the stage, its eyes surveying the room.

Each round characters within this room must make a **DC 13 Wisdom** save to resist becoming fatigued. The fatigue ends when the PC leaves the room. The stone slabs once served as beds for Nadroc's Wind Duke laborers. The skull of the human male corpse on the southwest slab has been utterly crushed by the stone greatclub of the statue upon the western stage, a marble representation of the Guardian of the Veil, a mythical Wind Duke figure who stands sentry between the lands of sleep and wakefulness. The statue itself is not attached to the floor, and may be tipped over with a **DC 18 Strength** check. It weighs 800 lbs.

Fatigue:
A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest (or leaving the room in this case), fatigued characters are no longer fatigued. Subsequent rounds lead to exhaustion up to level 3.

| Level | Effects                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2     | Speed halved                                   |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |

**Creatures**: When the PCs first arrive, a giant bombardier beetle stag stumbles out between the sleeping slabs. The fatigued beetle does not respond to the sounds of conflict in Area 16, preferring instead to enjoy a rare moment of rest. It attacks any non-beetle creature it sees, leading off with a spray of acid.

If any non-Wind Duke falls asleep on one of the stone slabs, the terracotta statue on the stage in the western alcove animates and attempts to smash the sleeper with its club. Treat as a slam attack, as the club is merely a part of the Guardian Statue.

**Treasure**: The corpse on the southwest slab wears masterwork leather armor emblazoned with the 8-pointed symbol of the Seekers and a silver ring worth 75 gp.
