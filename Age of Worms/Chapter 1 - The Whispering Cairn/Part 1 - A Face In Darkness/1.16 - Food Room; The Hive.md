The north and south walls of this large chamber taper in somewhat, and the nook of the far eastern wall rests a wide stone basin backed by a 5-foot-tall shelf. A hardened orange paste spills out over the 2-foot basin lip and covers much of the shelf. Thousands of tiny beetles with bright blue carapaces skitter and tunnel through the chalky substance. A keening insect chorus fills the room. A huge organic mass completely fills the room's southwest corner. Judging by the beetles spilling from within, it appears to be an enormous nest.

In ancient times, Nadroc's laborers sustained themselves on the nutritious substance generated by this fountain. The orange substance is still edible, but those who eat it must make a **DC 15 Constitution** save to resist becoming sickened for 1 hour due to the ubiquitous beetle waste.

The nest in the southwest corner has the consistency of papier-mâché, and can be cut through easily. If burned, it produces an acrid black smoke that grants concealment to every creature in the room for 6 rounds or until the smoke is blown away.

**Creatures**: This room serves as the central breeding ground of a colony of aggressive beetles who feed upon the edible orange sludge that fills the basin. When the PCs enter the room, the vermin skittering about the sludge coalesces into the form of an acid beetle swarm, and a  giant bombardier beetle, the cow of the colony, moves to attack, opening with a deadly spray of acid. The insects fight to the death.

**Treasure**: A **DC 13 Perception** check reveals the presence of three oblong lumps completely covered with orange sludge in the room's southeast corner. These are the skeletonized remains of 3 long-dead human figures in soiled red leather armor. An 8-pointed star symbol marks the left breast of each moldy suit of armor, a symbol that marks the dead as members of Ulavant's Seeker band, which met a grim end in the Lair of the Laborers some 60 years ago. A **DC 15 History** check identifies the symbol as belonging to the Seekers, a group of unscrupulous archeologists and pseudo-historians. One of the Seeker guards has 3 *Potions of Cure Light Wounds* and another bears a *Pearl of Power*.

A **DC 15 Perception** check in the ruined remains of the nest turns up a mummified human hand still wearing a *Ring of Feather Falling*.
