The wolves dwell in the nearly blocked-off terminus of the east wing. Medium or larger characters must get down on their hands and knees to negotiate the rubble passage. The far side is rank with the smell of wild animals. Irregular piles of rubble litter the den, as do hundreds of bones and bone fragments from the creatures' past meals. Most of these belong to animals, but a few are unmistakably human.

**Treasure**: a **DC 10 Search** check in the northern half of the den turns up an old leather backpack half-buried under a pile of humanoid bones. The bag contains an elaborate lantern of bronze inset with indigo glass panes. The lantern is worth 50 gp.

A **DC 16 Search** on the opposite side of the room turns up an intricately carved armband of unmistakable elven craftsmanship, bearing a repeating leaf motif. The armband is worth 75 gp to a non-elf and 100 gp to an elf NPC (such as the Diamond Lake mine manager Ellival Moonmeadow or one of his servitors).

A **DC 18 Search** of the rubble mostly blocking off the passage turns up what appears to be a marble index finger cracked off a statue. The finger exactly matches the right hand of the bas-relief sarcophagus lid figure in Area 7.
