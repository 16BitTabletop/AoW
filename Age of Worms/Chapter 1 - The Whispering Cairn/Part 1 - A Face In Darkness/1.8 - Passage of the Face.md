A thin passage extends into the shadows to the northeast. Perhaps 70 feet away, the passage ends in what looks like an enormous stone human face, its mouth open in an angry scream.
```

Thy physiology of the face is identical to that of the near-human sexless figure depicted on the bas-relief upon the sarcophagus in the room below. The screaming visage dominates the entire 20 foot by 20 foot wall at the end of the corridor. Anyone walking down the hall may make a **DC 15 Perception** check to notice several long scratch marks in the floor, as if something had been dragged toward the lip leading 40 feet down to Area 7. These marks were left by victims blown away by the blasting winds of the trap, leftovers of futile attempts to slow their trajectory by jamming a dagger into the floor. Anyone actively examining the floor automatically notices these marks.

**Trap**: A pressure plate 60 feet down the passage triggers if more than 60 lbs. are placed upon it. When this happens, the face animates and a terrible wind erupts from its wailing mouth. At the same time, the face's eyes spin with hypnotic illusory patterns in all of the colors of the rainbow that correspond with unlit lanterns in the chamber below. Anyone within the face's gaze must make a **DC 15 Will** save or become paralyzed, frozen in place and unable to move. Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt another saving throw to snap out of it.

The terrible wind is another major concern of anyone unlucky enough to be in the passage when the trap is sprung. On the first round, the mouth blasts a strong wind, with the intensity ratcheting up one category every round going from strong > severe > windstorm > hurricane.

Each round, creatures within the wind must make a **DC 17 Constitution** save or be subject to the wind's effects. Small creatures are potentially blown away as early as round 2, whereas medium creatures face that risk on round 3.

Blown away characters are knocked prone and tumble 1d4X10 feet, taking 1d4 points of subdual damage per 10 feet. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6x10 feet and take 2d6 points of subdual damage due to battering and buffeting. Non-flying creatures pushed over the edge of the shaft plummet to the floor below, suffering 4d6 points of damage upon impact. Such creatures may attempt to snatch the indigo lantern's chain with a successful **DC 13 Dexterity** save, with a success preventing the fall and damage.

The wind continues at hurricane force for 10 minutes before it stops and the trap resets itself. The only through the face is to ignite torches in Area 7. Once a torch has been lit, that color fails to appear in the face's hypnotic eyes. When all torches have been lit, the trap is effectively disarmed. The stone compressing the mouth's interior vanishes, allowing passage to the chamber beyond.
