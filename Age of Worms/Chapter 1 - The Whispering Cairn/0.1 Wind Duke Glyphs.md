As they explore the Whispering Cairn, the PCs encounter glyphs inscribed thousands of years ago by the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. These are the personal symbols of the general Icosiol (found on the base of the apparatus in Area 2 and the frescoes in Area 24), the hero Zosiel (on the sarcophagi in Area 7 and Area 25), and the architect Nadroc (found throughout the Architect's Lair). While the legend of the **Rod of Seven Parts*** is common currency among bards and dreamers, few specific details regarding Wind Duke culture, history, and writing remain. Their personal glyphs are thought to be the original written form of Auran, before the language of elemental air came to be represented by Draconic letterforms thousands of years ago.

*Comprehend Languages* or a Intelligence check reveal that the symbols are personal seals, and produce the name associated with each glyph (but not the significance of that name). Use the following chart to adjudicate any knowledge, History, or Arcana checks regarding the glyphs.

|      10      | The glyphs don't seem to be formed from a common alphabet, although they are reminiscent of arcane symbols representing elemental air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|      15      | The glyphs represent names, with each referring to a single individual. The glyph on the arcane apparatus at Area 2 probably represents the seal of the most important or highest-ranking of the three found in the Whispering Cairn. The glyph on the sarcophagi is the lowest-ranking of the three.                                                                                                                                        |
|      20      | The letterforms look similar to an ancient glyph-language called Vaati, which some unorthodox scholars consider the original written form of Auran.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|      25      | Vaati is an Auran word meaning "Wind Duke," and refers to the legendary Wind Dukes of Aaqa who forged the ***Rod of Seven Parts***. A book called the *Chronicle of Chan*, falsely attributed to a princess of elemental air, records a full roster of the Wind Dukes present at the Battle of Pesh and a general record of what took place there. (Allustran can requisition the book from the Free City's Great Library in a week's time.) |
