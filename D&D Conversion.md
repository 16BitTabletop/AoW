Rules for converting 3.X > 5.0 etc.


### DC Conversions
5E DC = (3E DC - 5) * (4 / 7) + 10

Simplified or AC: ((3.5DC -10)/2)+10
Gives much lower but more linear increase in DC

### Masterwork Weapons

The rule for masterwork weapons in 3rd edition was pretty straight forward:
_A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls._
_The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition, such as an arrow)._
This is a simple rule that is even more at home in the magic-devoid (at lower levels) 5th edition of the game.
And allows you to add some non-magical treasure to reward your players, or just to beef up your bad guys.

### 5th Edition Rule Conversion

I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t play this rule as is – there is really no need to change it.
Design Notes: You could easily change this to a +1 damage instead of to hit, which would more align itself with the design aesthetic of 5th edition, but I don’t mind the +1 to hit adjustment.

## Masterwork Armor & Shields

The rules for masterwork armor are slightly different. No, it doesn’t give you +1 to your AC (or even to hit, assuming you want to wack someone with your shield).
The 3rd edition rules are as follows:
_Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1._
_A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield._

### 5th Edition Rule Conversion

Converting masterwork armor proves to be a little more difficult as there is no Armor Check Penalty in D&D 5th edition, or rather it has changed from a number penalty to a number of skills to simply having Disadvantage on stealth checks.
D&D 5th edition does however have a Strength requirement for heavier armor. It also has a max dexterity quality for medium armors.
I would suggest making masterwork armor for medium armors give a +1 to the maximum Dex modifier the wearer can add to his AC when wearing the armor.
And for heavy armors you could allow a +1 Dexterity bonus (if the wearer’s Dexterity was high enough) or perhaps lower the Strength required to wear it by 1.
This would mean that a masterwork chain shirt would cost 200GP, but offer an AC of 13 + Dex modifier (max 3).
While a suit of masterwork plate armor would cost 1,650GP, but offer an AC of 18 + Dex modifier (max 1) OR could be worn by someone with a Strength of 14.

## Masterwork Items

Another type of masterwork were the items. The most popular of these being masterwork thieves’ tools.
The idea with masterwork items was that you would receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check when using them.
Here is the official rule:
_This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). Some examples of this sort of item… include masterwork artisan’s tools, masterwork thieves’ tools, disguise kit, climber’s kit, healer’s kit, and masterwork musical instrument._
Masterwork tools cost 50GP each, except for masterwork thieves’ tools, which cost 100GP.

### 5th Edition Rule Conversion

Like masterwork weapons, I am pretty happy to leave the rule as is. A +2 bonus to a skill check sounds like a lot, but I think having quality items would give you that kind of bonus.
To give an example, imagine the difference between a violinist playing a Stradivarius verses them playing a primary school’s violin.
I would only provide this bonus to someone who has the appropriate Tool proficiency however. Someone who is unskilled in playing a violin will still make the Stradivarius sound awful.
_Design Note: You could make this bonus a +1 if you so desire._

## Making Masterwork Items

A character (or NPC) could craft masterwork items in D&D 3rd edition – they simply had to make a DC20 craft check (craft is equivalent to Tool proficiencies in 5th edition) to be successful.

### 5th Edition Rule Conversion

In 5th edition a character can make items as per the rules in Xanathar’s Guide, as follows:
_In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost… Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location… A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment._
I would suggest simply adding the extra cost for creating a masterwork item (300GP for a weapon, 150GP for armour, and 50GP for an item) and then calculating the time it takes with the new total.
So, a masterwork weapon would take an additional 6 days to make.
I would also require a skill check – DC 15 isn’t unreasonable – to see if a masterwork item is created.
